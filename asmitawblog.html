                    <h2>Organization, relationships and driving efficiencies - How women can lead in household tech</h2>
                    <img class="image left" src ="images/stickies.png" alt="" > </img>
                    <p> Organization and Discipline - When I was home with my son for few months, I had a chance to visit the
                        non-working parents and their households, the nannies and their households, I went networking from
                        a single mother, therapist to the student who shares extended duties of mother and brother at their
                        home since she was 18, when her father got deported. I also saw the households of my dear non working
                        friends who would have parties to cater and community classes to attend. I was intrigued by these
                        experiences because till then all I did in my home was little bit cooking on the evennings and the
                        vacuuming and grocery on weekends. While I always liked to be minimalist, and not pay attention to
                        the decorations or staging, dressing kids or planning and arranging events or parties, I would crave
                        to visit households like these to learn new things about the organization. </p>

                    <img class="image left" src ="images/fishorganize.png" alt="" > </img>

                    <img class="image left" src ="images/fishorganize.png" alt="" > </img>
                    <img class="image left" src ="images/fishorganize.png" alt="" > </img>
                    
                    <p>If things are not organized and not kept in place, that drives inefficiencies. If things are messy vs
                        messier, I found the earlier is better. So the theme that came out thenafter, was wherever I could
                        improve the organization by spending a minute or two, I would. That was the key learning, if I find
                        myself confused, cluttered or not creating anything, now I stop, step back and try to organize, thoughts,
                        things relations and then take a plung. It has helped me a lot in the next moves I made in the career
                        thenafter. </p>

                    <p> If it helps to visualize the change, now I keep 3 pair of shoes in the place instead worrying about all
                        10, I clean up my desk in the aftrnoons when I am sleepy instead of reaching for a coffee and bringing
                        one more cup to put aside. I got good at sorting and piling on the fly. Most of my social phone calls
                        are assisted with some organization around office or around the house, its still timebound and although
                        I am not fan of house keeping or staging, when I touch things often, the mental picture gets stored
                        and it helps me recall better. </p>

                    <p> Organizing stuff - Another learning is that basic organization requires a survey or tally of what you
                        got, deciding the place for all of those things, sometimes requring to give out your possessions
                        so that at the end you only possess valuable and essentials, sometimes getting more tools. Also this
                        process of organization requires you to put the physical things in the perspective of loss, love,
                        fullfillment, money and time. Once your "things" have these tags its easy for you to arrange in the
                        way that can be least time consuming for each of your items to retrieve and process it in timely
                        manner. </p>

                    <p> Rythm and frequency - Not to say organising and clearing clutter is an ongoing process, you may assign
                        one or two days a quarter or year, everyone is different and their circumstances are too. The younger
                        the person is, there are more chances of running into unimaginable clutter. And the older you get
                        there is less stamina and motivation to hang on to those worldly things in that microscopic scale
                        and shallowness.</p>

                    <p> Organising Relationships - When we are young, we have friends and families and parents of friends and
                        your baby sitters and teachers and extended curriculum class teachers and more friends we met at
                        the camp and so on.... If however you want to keep all of them when you are 30, I hope I am not the
                        only one who failed to keep all of those relationships intact at such a late age. Yet the gold is
                        gold. the Best friends and closest family would stay with you forever. The point is can we apply
                        the same organization principals to the relationships and get the same rewards of fullfillment and
                        same rest at mind when we organize and label the relations as essential, worthy, enriching, progressive
                        and so on. Would you ever clear the relationship clutter? May be organize your facebook as well
                        ? give away some of the grudges and move on - forgiveness is like that, its like donating your stuff
                        to "good will".
                        <p>

                            <p> So with that seagway and back on track for organization in household, in those days when I was
                                networking with women - I have seen so much efficiency in women to do all those things as
                                a second nature to keep the families and house and kids all alligned and on track for success.
                                Without missing the beat of the music of their relations.</p>

                            <p> My Question is how can we chanellize that same brilliant inbuilt talent to organize the teams
                                and deliver reults, while making less costly mistakes, keeping everyone engaged and motivated
                                - for all organizations, let it be a winning game like our home. The more questions and critical
                                thinking you do, more wise you would become - applying that to this scenario, I inspected
                                women around me from my past to present workplaces and teams, I realized a theme.

                                <p>
                                    To deliver the same results at the workplace, we must welcome each other and make us
                                        feel home. Its the teaching and childcare and medicine and nursing and other fields
                                        that have always enjoyed the endless contributions of women, it tells clearly that
                                        those are the battlegrounds they worry much about wining as they speak to them naturally.
                                        Let the business speak to you like your home does.</p>

                                <p> The bottomline is, with growing number of career minded tech loving girls, Women for sure
                                    would lead the "tech in household " when it comes to that. </p>

                                <p> Concrete examples what I mean by such tech, and I would love to be a part of it.
                                    <p>
