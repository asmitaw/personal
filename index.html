Also saw some seriously committed people on the planet chasing their life's dreams - visiting seven seas, cave hunting and rock climbing and coming to office at 4am and fuelling their daughters dream to be a broadway artist and raising their family on farms and doing serious motorcycle riding (was partly involved). And adapting stray animals as pets and the list goes on...Amazing humans.</p>
